    "The goals of this assignment are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Help to ensure students have **properly installed and setup your Python environment for this course**.\n",
    "2. Help students familiarize themselves with **Gradescope** for assignment submission and autograding.\n",
    "3. Help to ensure students have **activated their GT Github Accounts** which will be used to distribute all subsequent assignments in this course.\n",
    "4. Provide an optional exercise for students to **evaluate their own course preparedness**.\n",
    "5. Provide a brief Python tutorial/refresher to serve as a starting point for students new to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This course uses **Python** and it is expected that are either familiar with Python already or will be able to pickup Python quickly on the fly.\n",

    "#### 2. [Git Tips](#git)\n",

    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "Your files will be graded by the Assignment 0 autograder on Gradescope. In general for this course, **the grade you see on Gradescope will be the grade you get, unless an OSI violation is detected**, in which case we will reach out to you separately with OSI procedures. Please note that, Gradescope does NOT automatically enable your BEST submission, it enables your most RECENT submission. Before an assignment deadline, **ALWAYS check that you have activated the submission you want graded in Gradescope**.\n",

    "<font color = 'red'>**Note:** It is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that you submit this assignment before the deadline as completion of the assignment is necessary for us to release the remaining course assignments to you.

    "In order to help you evaluate your readiness for this course, we've provided a warmup task for you. Students are expected to be able to solve this warmup on their own and it should be a refresher of Python and computer programming concepts. If students have not programmed in Python or have not learned this concept before, the expectation is that students should be able to learn Python on the fly and learn the prerequisite programming concepts on their own time. **For this task only, you may reference resources outside of the approved course resources, however please refrain from referencing any pseudocode and try to complete this evaluation on your own.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A common data structure used in search algorithms is the **Priority Queue**, often used to identify which path to investigate next, prioritizing shorter paths in hopes of finding the shortest path from a source to a destination. In this exercise, we ask you to implement a Priority Queue that takes on elements in the form of a tuple: `(priority, payload)`, where elements with a higher priority (in our case a *smaller value*) should be removed first, and if two elements have the same priority, the element that joined the queue earlier should be removed first (FIFO ordering). The file for you to edit and submit to Gradescope with `first_submission.py` above is `priority_queue.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common implementation of a Priority Queue is via a *Binary Heap*. Binary heaps are a popular option because they provide *amortized $O(1)$ insertion and $O(\\log(n))$ removal time*. To pass our tests, your Priority Queue must perform better than the naive implementation in our tests (`InsertionSortQueue`), which sorts the entire list after every insertion. We recommend looking at the Python documentation for their [`heapq` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html) for inspiration if you are stuck, although please do your best to try to figure it out on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do **NOT** add or remove any imports to `priority_queue.py`! If you find some imports helpful while you are working on the file, please make sure to remove them before submitting to Gradescope. Some local tests have been provided for you below, note that they are not comprehensive and you are encouraged to add your own!\n",
    "\n",
    "> **FAQ**\n",
    "> 1. **Can I use special Python libraries?** No. You may not use libraries like `heapq` for your implementation, it is expected that students be able to implement the Priority Queue from scratch. Only the libraries provided in this assignment are allowed.\n",
    "> 2. Implement the functions `pop` and `append` in the `PriorityQueue` class at a minimum. You can add extra helper functions within the class if you'd like and you may also implement `remove` if you find that necessary.\n",
    "> 3. Preserve FIFO. It is possible for the priority queue to receive two elements with the same priority. In the event that that occurs, the element that joined the priority queue first should be returned first. The best hint we can give you is to think about using some sort of a counter to keep track of when each node joined the Priority Queue...\n",
    "> 4. Generalize. The nodes provided to the priority queue will be Python tuples in the form of `(priority, payload)`. You may assume that the datatype for `priority` is a standard Python datatype (i.e. `int`, `float`, `str`, etc.). The `payload` can be of any datatype (standard or custom).\n",
    "> 5. It is possible for duplicate nodes to enter the queue. (i.e. identical priority, identical payload)"
