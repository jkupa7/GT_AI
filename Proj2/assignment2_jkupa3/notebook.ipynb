    "The goals of this assignment are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Verify student understanding of **foundational adversarial game search algorithms** introduced in lecture. (Minimax)\n",
    "2. Explore **improved adversarial search algorithms** that build upon the foundational adversarial search algorithms. (AlphaBeta)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create an AI that can play and win a game of 2 Rook Isolation. Your AI will be tested against several pre-baked AIs. You will implement your AI in Python 3.9, using our provided code as a starting point. \n",
    "\n",
    "In case we haven't got this into your heads enough: **start early!!!** It is entirely possible, and probably likely, that a large part of your next 2 weeks will be devoted to this assignment, but we hope that it is worth it and you will really enjoy it! \n",

    "The grade you receive for the assignment will be determined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Section | Points    | Condition |\n",
    "| ------- | --------- | --------- |\n",
    "| 2a | 5 points | You write an evaluation function, OpenMoveEval, which returns the number of moves that the AI minus the number of moves opponent can make, and your evaluation function performs correctly on some sample boards we provide. |\n",
    "| 2a | 30 points | Your AI defeats a random player >= 80% of the time. |\n",
    "| 2b | 20 points | Your AI defeats an agent with OpenMoveEval function that uses minimax to level 2  >= 80% of the times. |\n",
    "| 2b | 20 points | Your AI defeats an agent with OpenMoveEval function that uses alphabeta to level 4  >= 70% of the times. |\n",
    "| 2c | 20 points | Your AI defeats an agent with OpenMoveEval function that uses iterative deepening and alpha-beta pruning >= 70% of the time. |\n",
    "| 2c | 5 points  | Your AI defeats an agent with Peter's secret evaluation function that uses iterative deepening and alpha-beta pruning and optimizes various aspects of the game player >= 80% of the time  |\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the table there are three autograded sections, each having the following submission frequency restrictions:\n",
    "- **Section 2a** - 1 submission per 30 minutes.\n",
    "- **Section 2b** - 6 submissions per 360 minutes.\n",
    "- **Section 2c** - 6 submissions per 360 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Helper Files\n",
    "While you'll only have to edit `notebook.ipynb` and submit the exported `submission.py`, there are a number of notable files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `isolation.py`: Includes the `Board` class and a function for printing out a game as text. Do **NOT** change contents of this file. We have the same file on the server's side, so any changes will not be accounted for.\n",
    "2. `notebook.ipynb`: Where you'll implement the required methods for your agents.\n",
    "3. `player_submission_tests.py`: Sample tests to validate your agents locally.\n",
    "4. `test_players.py`: Contains 2 player types for you to test agents locally:\n",
    "    - `RandomPlayer` - chooses a legal move randomly from among the available legal moves\n",
    "    - `HumanPlayer` - allows *YOU* to play against the AI in terminal (else use `InteractiveGame` in jupyter)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we've included a number of local unit tests to help you test your player and evaluation function as well as to give you an idea of how the classes are used."

    "## About the Game\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules of 2 Rook Isolation are a variation of the original Isolation game. In the original form of the game there are two players, each with their own game piece, and a 9-by-9 grid of squares. At the beginning of the game, the first player places their piece on any square. The second player follows suit, and places their piece on any one of the available squares. From that point on, the players alternate turns moving their piece like a queen in chess (any number of open squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally). When the piece is moved, the square that was previously occupied is blocked, and cannot be used for the remainder of the game. The first player who is unable to move their queen loses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this variant called 2 Rook Isolation, the queens are replaced by rooks, and their moves behave like a rook in chess (any move going up, down, left or right for the entire length of the board unless blocked by another piece). Each player has two rooks and the first two moves for both players must be placing the rooks on the board. For clarity, examine the scenario below:\n",

    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/rook_1.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is followed by both players placing their second rooks R2 and R4. Next, Player 1 chooses to move R1 and the valid blocks it can be moved to are highlighted in dark blue color.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/rook_2.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "R1 decides to move 2 blocks to the right, leaving the space behind blocked (shown in black). The red shows open spots for R4 on Player 2's next turn. We see that R1 has blocked some potential moves for R4.\n",

While you can use Iterative Deepening & Alpha-Beta (ID+AB) to beat our agents in all of the sections, going directly for ID+AB is error prone. As such, we highly recommend you to start with MiniMax (MM), then implement Alpha-Beta (AB), and only then go for ID+AB.\n",

However, in case you want to have an additonal parameter you can do it at the very end of parameter list (see examples below).

    "- You're right, and that's on purpose. Each of the bullets below try to walk you through how you may want to think about beating the remaining agents.\n",
    "    - First up is the alphabeta agent. Vanilla alphabeta (that is, alphabeta with no optimization) may not do so well against this agent. However, any agent that searches deeper with the same algorithm probably has a bigger advantage. You may learn about a method that allows your algorithm to search in such a way that you can find the maximum search depth without running out of time. This will probably come up in class or you can read through the book to find out what you are looking for.\n",
    "    - Next to beat is the agent with iterative deepening. This one is a little harder to think about, given that you may have used all the tools that you may think of to try a make a \"better\" agent. But you may have just implemented the evaluation function that was discussed in class. Maybe we can do better - like checking for winning moves and prioritizing those! Or if you are feeling really creative, you can always try editing the `CustomEvalFn` below this cell and come up with an awesome idea of your own.\n",
    "    - Now to Peter's agent with the secret evaluation function. Here we have nothing to tell you. Use everything in your toolbox and within the class rules to defeat it. This is by far the hardest 5 points to get! Good luck and have fun!\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Remember that you may want to edit the methods in the cell with the `CustomPlayer` class to try and implement some of the above. You are certainly free to as long as you adhere to the general rules about editing provided code (which can be found by reading the cell above the `CustomPlayer` code)."
