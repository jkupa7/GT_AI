## Overview 
Machine Learning is a subfield of AI, and Decision Trees are a type of Supervised Machine Learning. In supervised 
learning an agent will observe sample input and output and learn a function that maps the input to output. The function
is the hypothesis ''' y = f(x)'''. To test the hypothesis we give the agent a *test set* different than the training 
set. A hypothesis generalizes well if it correctly predicts the y value. If the value is *finite*, the problem is a 
*classification* problem, if it is a *real number* it is considered a *regression* problem.
When classification problems have exactly two values (+,-) it is Boolean classification. When there are more than 
two values it is called Multi-class classification. Decision trees are relatively simple but highly successful types 
of supervised learners. Decision trees take a vector of attribute values as input and return a decision.

* All functions must be completed in **_submission.py_** for full credit

**Important**:
Submissions to Gradescope are rate limited for this assignment. **You can submit two submissions every 60 minutes during the duration of the assignment**.

Since we want to see you innovate and imagine new ways to do this, we know this can also cause you to fail 
(spectacularly in my case) For that reason you will be able to select your strongest submission to Gradescope. 
In your Gradescope submission history, you will be able to mark your best submission as 'Active'. 
This is a students responsibility and not faculty.

### Part 0: Vectorization!
_[10 pts]_

* File to use to benchmark tests: **_vectorize.csv_**

The vectorization portion of this assignment will teach you how to use matrices to significantly increase the speed
and decrease processing complexity of your AI problems. Matrix operations, linear algebra and vector space axioms and
operations will be challenging to learn. Learn this, and it will benefit you throughout OMSCS courses and 
your career.

You will not be able to meet time requirements, nor process large datasets without Vectorization
Whether one is training a deep neural network on millions of images, building random forests for a U.S. National Insect 
Collection dataset, or optimizing algorithms, machine learning requires _extensive_ use of vectorization. The NumPy Open
Source project provides the **numpy** python scientific computing package using low-level optimizations written in C. If
you find the libraries useful, consider contributing to the body of knowledge (e.g. help update and advance numpy)

You will not meet the time limits on this assignment without vectorization. This small section will introduce you to 
vectorization and one of the high-demand technologies in python. We encourage you to use any numpy function to do the 
functions in the warmup section. You will need to beat the non-vectorized code to get full points.

TAs will offer little help on this section. This section was created to help get you ready for this and other assignments; 
feel free to ask other students on Ed Discussion or use some training resources. (e.g. https://numpy.org/learn/)

How grading works:
1. We run your vectorized code against non-vectorized code 500 times, as long as you have the correct answer and your 
   average time is significantly less than the average time of the non-vectorized code, you will get the points.

#### Functions to complete in the `Vectorization` class:
1. `vectorized_loops()`
2. `vectorized_slice()`
3. `vectorized_flatten()`
4. `vectorized_glue()`
5. `vectorized_mask()`

## The Assignment

E. Thadeus Starner<sup>5<sup>th</sup></sup> is the 5<sup>th</sup> incarnation of the great innovator and legendary 
pioneer of Starner Eradicatus Mosquitoes. For centuries the mosquito has imparted only harm on human health, aiding 
in transmission of malaria, dengue, Zika, chikungunya, CoVid, and countless other diseases impact millions of people 
and animals every year. The Starner Eradicatus, *Anopheles Stephensi* laser zapper has obtained the highest level of 
precision, recall, and accuracy in the industry!</br>
<img src="./files/Assign4-2.gif" alt="The Starner Eradicatus Mosquitoes legacy..." /></br>
[Creative Commons sourced][cc]</br>
The secret is the classification engine which has compiled an unmatched library of classification data collected from 
153 countries. Flying insects from the tiny Dicopomorpha echmepterygis (Parasitic Wasp) to the giant titanus giganteus 
(Titan Beetle) are carefully catalogued in a comprehensive digital record and indexed to support fast and correct 
classification. This painstaking attention to detail was ordered by A. Thadeus<sup>1<sup>st</sup></sup> to address 
a tumultuous backlash from the International Pollinators Association to a high mortality among beneficial pollinators.</br>
<img src="./files/Assign4-3.gif" alt="Call to action, save the farms..." /></br>
[Creative Commons sourced][cc]</br>
E. Thadeus' close friend Skeeter Norvig, a former CMAO (Chief Mosquito Algorithm Officer) and pollinator advocate has 
approached E.T. with an idea. The agriculture industry has been experiencing terrible losses worldwide due to the 
diaphorina citri (Asian Citrus Psyllid), drosophila suzuki (spotted wing Drosophila), and the bactrocera tyron 
(Queensland fruit fly). </br>
<img src="./files/Assign4-4.gif" alt="Skeeter asks for help from E.T...." /></br>
[Creative Commons sourced][cc]</br>
Skeeter explains his idea to E.T. to generalize the Starner Eradicatus zapper to handle a variety of these pests. 
Wonderful! E.T. exclaims, and becomes wildly excited at the opportunity to bring such an important benefit to 
the World.</br>
<img src="./files/Assign4-5.gif" alt="E.T. and Skeeter tell the story to the team..." /></br>
[Creative Commons sources below][cc]</br>
The wheels of invention lit up the research Scrum that morning as E.T. and Skeeter storyboard the solution. People are
calling out all the adjustments, wing acoustics, laser power and duration, going through xyz positioning, angular 
velocity and acceleration calculations, speed, occlusion noise and tracking errors. You as the lead DT software 
engineer are taking it all in, when you realize and speak up..., sir... Sir... <em>SIR...</em> and a hush falls. Sir, we are 
doing Boolean classification and will need to refactor to multi-class classification. E.T. turns to you and with that look
in his eye, gives you and your team two weeks to deliver multi-class classification!

You will build, train and test decision tree models to perform multi-class classification tasks. You will learn 
how decision trees and random forests work. This will help you develop an intuition for how and why accuracy differs 
for training and testing data based on different parameters.

### Assignment Introduction
For this assignment we need an explicit way to make structured decisions. The `DecisionNode` class will be used to 
represent a decision node as some atomic choice in a multi-class decision graph. You must use this implementation
for the nodes of the Decision Tree for this assignment to pass the tests and receive credit.

An object of type 'DecisionNode' can represent a 
* decision node
  * *left*: will point to less than or equal values of the split value, type DecisionNode, True evaluations
  * *right*: will point to greater than values of the split value, type DecisionNode, False evaluations
  * *decision_function*: evaluates an attribute's value and maps each vector to a descendant
  * *class_label*: None
* leaf node
    * *left*: None
    * *right*: None
    * *decision_function*: None
    * *class_label*: A leaf node's class value
* Note that in this representation 'True' values for a decision take us to the left.

### Part 1: Building a Binary Tree by Hand
#### Part 1a: Build a Tree
_[10 Pts]_

In `build_decision_tree()`, construct a decision tree capable of predicting the class (col y) of each example. 
Using the columns A0-A3 build the decision tree and nodes in python to classify the data with 100% accuracy. 
Your tests should use as few attributes as possible, break ties with equal select attributes by selecting
the one which classifies the greatest number of examples correctly. For ties in number of attributes and 
correct classifications use the lower index numbers (e.g. select **A1** over **A2**)
<p>

|  X  |   A0    |   A1    |   A2    |   A3    |  y  |
| --- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --- |
| x01 |  1.1125 | -0.0274 | -0.0234 |  1.3081 |  1  |
| x02 |  0.0852 |  1.2190 | -0.7848 | -0.7603 |  2  |
| x03 | -1.1357 |  0.5843 | -0.3195 |  0.8563 |  0  |
| x04 |  0.9767 |  0.8422 |  0.2276 |  0.1197 |  1  |
| x05 |  0.8904 | -1.7606 |  0.3619 | -0.8276 |  0  |
| x06 |  2.3822 | -0.3122 | -2.0307 | -0.5065 |  2  |
| x07 |  0.7194 | -0.4061 | -0.7045 | -0.0731 |  2  |
| x08 | -2.9350 |  0.7810 | -2.5421 |  3.0142 |  0  |
| x09 |  2.4343 | -1.5380 | -2.7953 |  0.3862 |  2  |
| x10 |  0.8096 | -0.2601 |  0.5556 |  0.6288 |  1  |
| x11 |  0.8577 | -0.2217 | -0.6973 | -0.1095 |  1  |
| x12 |  0.0568 |  0.0696 |  1.1153 | -1.1753 |  0  |


#### Requirements:
The total number of elements(nodes, leaves) in your tree should be < 10

#### Hints:
To get started, it might help to **draw out the tree by hand** with each attribute representing a node.

To create a decision function for `DecisionNode`, you are allowed to use python lambda expressions:
```
func = lambda feature : feature[2] <= 0.356
```

This will choose the left node if the A2 attribute is <= 0.356.

For example, a hand binary tree might look like this:
```
func = lambda feature : feature[0] <= -0.918
```
in this example if feature[0] is evaluated as true then it would belong to the leaf for class = 1; else class = 0
> <p>
> <img src="files/tree_example.png" alt="Tree Example"/>

You would write your code like this:
```
func0 = lambda feature : feature[0] <= -0.918
decision_tree_root = DecisionNode(None, None, func0, None)
or
decision_tree_root = DecisionNode(None, None, lambda feature : feature[0] <= -0.918, None)
decision_tree_root.left = DecisionNode(None, None, None, class1)
decision_tree_root.right = DecisionNode(None, None, None, class0)
return decision_tree_root
```

##### Part 1b: Precision, Recall, Accuracy and Confusion Matrix
_[12 pts]_

To build the Starner Zapper next-gen, we will need to keep the high levels of Precision, Recall, and Accuracy
inculcated in the legacy products. In binary/boolean classification we find these metrics in terms of true positives, 
false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. So it should be simple right?
</p>

#### Helpful Information:
A confusion matrix is a table that counts the number of occurrences between the true/actual
classification and the predicted classification. The columns stand for your model prediction 
and the rows the true label of the feature.</br>
Your confusion matrix will be a K x K matrix, where K = number of classes. Notice that the correct classifier
predictions form the diagonal of the matrix. For each class, its diagonal will tell you how many times your 
classifier predicted correctly (TP), its column (TP omitted) will inform you how many times your classifier
predicted a positive value incorrectly (FP), where its row (TP omitted) will inform you how many times your
classifier did not correctly predict an actual positive (FN). You will find the referenced material very helpful
for your calculations. Recall and Precision return lists whereas Accuracy will return a value. We know that may
be illogical, the world of AI has many versions of this so we are trying to limit getting lost in which version.
Helpful numpy functions are, diag, diagonal, sum(by axis) for this part of the assignment.
</br>

**We will use Accuracy, but encourage you to think about the other versions:**
- *Accuracy* TP + TN / TP + TN + FP + FN **USE THIS**
  - ***Will tell you overall accuracy but not bias, why?***</br>
- *Balanced Accuracy:* Sum of the ratios (accurate divided by sum of its row) divided by number of classes. 
  - ***How could this skew the results, and why?***</br>
- *Balanced Accuracy Weighted:* Balanced Accuracy with weighting added in the numerator and denominator. 
  - ***Would this be good for the problem?***</br>

**Precision:** TP / TP + FP</br>
**Recall:** TP / TP + FN</br>

To-do
* Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall

    n_classes = 3
    clf_matrix = confusion_matrix(classes, answer, n_classes)
    clf_accuracy = accuracy(classes, answer, n_classes )
    clf_precision = precision(classes, answer, n_classes)
    clf_recall = recall(classes, answer, n_classes)

### Part 2: Decision Tree Learning
#### Part 2a: Gini
_[10 pts]_

Purity, we strive for purity, alike Sir Galahad the Pure... 
Splitting at a decision is all about purity. You are trying to improve information gain which means,
you are trying to gain purer divisions of the data. Through purer divisions of the data it is more 
ordered. This relates to entropy in physics, where ordered motion produces more energy. Through ordered 
data you gain more information on the defining characteristics (attributes) of something observed.

We will use GINI impurity and the GINI Impurity Index to calculate the  `gini_impurity` and `gini_gain()` on 
the splits to calculate Information Gain. The challenge will be to choose the best attribute at each decision
with the lowest impurity and the highest index. At each attribute we search for the best value to split on, 
the hypotheses are compared against what we currently know, because would we want to split if we learn nothing?
Hints:
* [gini impurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Gini_impurity)
* [information gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_gain_in_decision_trees) 
* The Gini Gain follows a similar approach to information gain, replacing entropy with Gini Impurity.
* Numpy helpful functions include advanced indexing, and filtering arrays with masks, slicing, stacking and concatenating
<p>

#### Functions to complete in the `submission` module:
1. `gini_impurity()`
2. `gini_gain()`

#### Part 2b: Decision Tree Learning
_[25 pts]_
* Data to train and test with: **_simple_binary.csv, simple_multi.csv, mod_complex_binary.csv, mod_complex_multi.csv_**

* Grading:
    * 15 pts: average test accuracy over 10 rounds should be >= 50%
    * 20 pts: average test accuracy over 10 rounds should be >= 60%
    * 25 pts: average test accuracy over 10 rounds should be >= 75%
</br>

Meanwhile back in the lab...
As the size of our flying training set grows, it rapidly becomes impractical to build multiclass trees by hand. 
We need to add a class with member functions to manage this, it is too much! 
</br>To do list:
* Initialize the class with useful variables and assignments
* Fill out the member function that will fit the data to the tree, using build
* Fill out the build function
* Fill out the classify function

For starters, consider these helpful hints for the construction of a decision tree from a given set of examples:
1. Watch your base cases:
   1. If all input vectors have the same class, return a leaf node with the appropriate class label.
   2. If a specified depth limit is reached, return a leaf labeled with the most frequent class.
   3. Splits producing 0, 1 length vectors
   4. Splits producing less or equivalent information
   5. Division by zero
2. Use the DecisionNode class
3. For each attribute alpha: evaluate the information gained by splitting on the attribute `alpha`.
4. Let `alpha_best` be the attribute value with the highest information gain.
5. As you progress in this assignment this is going to be tested against larger and more complex datasets, think about how it will affect your identification and selection of values to test.
6. Create a decision node that splits on `alpha_best` and split the data and classes by this value.
7. When splitting a dataset and classes, they must stay synchronized, do not orphan or shift the indexes independently
8. Use recursion to build your tree, by using the split lists, remember true goes left using decide
9. Your features and classify should be in numpy arrays where for dataset of size (_m_ x _n_) the features would be (_m_ x _n_-1) and classify would be (_m_ x _1_)
10. The features are real numbers, you will need to split based on a threshold. Consider different approaches for what this threshold might be.

First, in the `DecisionTree.__build_tree__()` method implement the above algorithm.
Next, in `DecisionTree.classify()`, write a function to produce classifications for a list of features once your decision tree has been built.

How grading works:
1. We load **_mod_complex_multi.csv_** and create our cross-validation training and test set with a `k=10` folds.  We use our own `generate_k_folds()` method.
2. We fit the (folded) training data onto the tree then classify the (folded) testing data with the tree.
3. We check the accuracy of your results versus the true results and we return the average of this over k=10 iterations.

#### Functions to complete in the `DecisionTree` class:
1. `__build_tree__()`
2. `fit()`
3. `classify()`
---

#### Part 2c: Validation
_[7 pts]_

* File to use: **_part23_data.csv_**
* Allowed use of numpy, collections.Counter, and math.log
* Grading: average test accuracy over 10 rounds should be >= 80%

Reserving part of your data as a test set can lead to unpredictable performance as you may not have a complete set or 
proportionately balanced representation of the class labels. We can overcome this limitation by using k-fold cross validation.
There are many benefits to using cross-validation. See book 3rd Ed Evaluating and Choosing the Best Hypothesis 18.4

In `generate_k_folds()`, we'll split the dataset at random into k equal subsections. Then iterating on each of our k 
samples, we'll reserve that sample for testing and use the other k-1 for training. Averaging the results of each fold 
should give us a more consistent idea of how the classifier is doing across the data as a whole.
For those who are not familiar with k folds cross-validation, please refer the tutorial here:
[A Gentle Introduction to k-fold Cross-Validation](https://machinelearningmastery.com/k-fold-cross-validation/).

How grading works:
1. The same as 2b however, we use your `generate_k_folds()` instead of ours.

#### Functions to complete in the `submission` module:
1. `generate_k_folds()`

---

### Part 3: Random Forests
_[25 pts]_

* File to use: **_mod_complex_binary.csv, mod_complex_multi.csv_**
* Allowed use of numpy, collections.Counter, and math.log
* Allowed to write additional functions to improve your score
* Allowed to switch to Entropy and splitting entropy
* Grading: 
  * 15 pts: average test accuracy over 10 rounds should be >= 50%
  * 20 pts: average test accuracy over 10 rounds should be >= 70%
  * 25 pts: average test accuracy over 10 rounds should be >= 80%

Decision boundaries drawn by decision trees are very sharp, and fitting a decision tree of unbounded depth to a set of
training examples almost inevitably leads to overfitting. In an attempt to decrease the variance of your classifier 
you are going to use a technique called 'Bootstrap Aggregating' (often abbreviated as 'bagging').
Decision stumps are very short decision trees used in Ensemble classification such as Random Forests
* They are usually short (depth limited)
* They use smaller (but more of them) random datasets for training
* They use a subset of attributes drawn randomly from the training set
* They fit the tree to the sampled dataset and are considered specialized to the set
* Advanced learners may use weighting of their classifier trees to improve performance
* They use majority voting (every tree in the forest votes) to classify a sample

A Random Forest is a collection of decision trees, built as follows:
1. For every tree we're going to build:
   1. Subsample the examples provided us (with replacement) in accordance with a provided example subsampling rate.
   2. From the samples, choose attributes (without replacement) at random to learn on (as specified in attribute subsampling rate)
   3. Fit a decision tree to the subsample of data we've chosen (to a limited depth).

When sampling attributes you choose from the entire set of attributes for every sample drawn (but specify the sampling 
method does not use replacement)

Complete `RandomForest.fit()` to fit the decision tree as we describe above, and fill in `RandomForest.classify()` to 
classify a given list of examples. You can use your decision tree implementation or create another.

Your features and classify should use numpy arrays datasets of (_m_ x _n_) features of (_m_ x _n_-1) and classify of (_n_ x _1_).

To test, we will be using a forest with 80 trees, with a depth limit of 5, example subsample rate of 0.3 and attribute 
subsample rate of 0.3

How grading works:
1. Similar to 2b but with the call to Random Forest.

#### Functions to complete in the `RandomForest` class:
1. `fit()`
2. `classify()`

Decision boundaries drawn by decision trees are very sharp, and fitting a decision tree of unbounded depth to a set of
training examples almost inevitably leads to overfitting. In an attempt to decrease the variance of your classifier
you are going to use a technique called 'Boosting' implementing one of the boosting algorithms such as, 
Ada-, Gradient- and XG-, boost or your personal favorite.
Similar to RF, the Decision stumps are short decision trees used in these Ensemble classification methods
* They are usually short (depth limited)
* They use smaller (but more of them) random datasets for training with sampling bias
* They use a subset of attributes sampled from the training set
* They fit the tree to the sampled dataset and are considered specialized to the set
* They use weighting of their sampling and classifiers to reflect the balance or unbalance of the data
* They use majority voting (every tree in the forest votes) to classify a sample

Ada-boost Algorithm example [Zhu, et al.]:
<ul>N Samples, M classifiers, W weights, C classifications, K classes, I indicator</ul>
<ol><li>Initialize the observation weights wi = 1/n, i = 1, 2, . . . , n.</li>
<li>For m = 1 to M:</li><ol>
<li>Fit a classifier T(m)(x) to the training data using weights wi.</li>
<li>Compute err(m) = Sum(i=1..n)wi I(ci != T(m)(xi)) / Sum(i=1..n) wi</li>
<li>Compute α(m) = log (1−err(m)/err(m)) + log(K − 1).</li>
<li>Set wi ← wi · exp (α(m) I(ci != T(m)(xi)), i = 1, . . . , n.</li>
<li>Re-normalize wi.</li></ol>
<li>Output C(x) = argmax(k) sum(m=1..M) α(m) · I(T(m)(x) = k).</li>
</ol>

When sampling attributes you choose from the entire set of attributes without replacement based 
on the weighted distribution. Notice that you favor or bias towards misclassified samples, which
improves your overall accuracy. Visualize how the short trees balance classification bias.

Complete `ChallengeClassifier.fit()` to fit the decision tree as we describe above, and fill in `ChallengeClassifier.classify()` to 
classify examples. Use your decision tree implementation as your classifier or create another.

Your features and classify should use numpy arrays datasets of (_m_ x _n_) features of (_m_ x _n_-1) and 
classes of (_m_ x _1_).

How grading works:
To test, we will be running 10 rounds, using your boosting with 200 trees, with a depth limit of 3, 
example subsample rate of 0.1 and attribute subsample rate of 0.2. You will have a time limit.

#### Functions to complete in the `ChallengeClassifier` class:
1. `init()`
2. `fit()`
3. `classify()`

### Part 5: Return Your name!
_[1 pts]_
Return your name from the function `return_your_name()`

### Helper Notebook

#### Note: You do not need to implement anything in this notebook. This part is not graded, so you can skip this part if you wish to. This notebook is just for your understanding purpose. It will help you visualize Decision trees on the dataset provided to you.
The notebook Visualize_tree.iypnb can be use to visualize tree on the datasets. Things you can Observe:
1. How the values are split?
2. What is the gini value at leaf nodes?
3. What does internal nodes represents in this DT?
4. Why all leaf nodes are not at same depth?

Feel free to change and experiment with this notebook. you can look and use Information gain as well instead of gini to 
see how the DT built based on that.
